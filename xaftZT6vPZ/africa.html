<h1>Egypt,</h1>

<p>Egypt, a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East, dates to the time of the pharaohs.
   Millennia-old monuments sit along the fertile Nile River Valley, including Giza's colossal Pyramids
    and Great Sphinx as well as Luxor's hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple and Valley of the Kings tombs. 
    The capital, Cairo, is home to Ottoman landmarks like Muhammad Ali Mosque and the
   Egyptian Museum, a trove of antiquities.</p>

 <p> Nigeria, an African country on the Gulf of Guinea, has many natural landmarks
   and wildlife reserves. Protected areas such as Cross River National Park and Yankari 
   National Park have waterfalls, dense rainforest, savanna and rare primate habitats.
    One of the most recognizable sites is Zuma Rock, a 725m-tall monolith outside the 
    capital of Abuja 
  thatâ€™s pictured on the national currency.</p>
